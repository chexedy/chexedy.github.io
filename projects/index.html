        <h4>This is a custom copy of the game Fishing Frenzy I developed for Rutgers COGS (Creation of Games Society), a game development club. It originally was designed to be for 2-4 players using a controller and would be played in the COGS Party Launcher, a Mario Party like system made for the club. This version is watered down to 2 players and uses keyboard controls.</h4>
