        <h3>I'm currently learning these languages...</h3>
        <h4>Java - I know the basics of the language and I am practicing to master it.</h4>
        <h4>Python - While I'm not as good as it as I am with Java, I'm still working to get better at it.</h4>
        <h4>C - I've started learning it as part of my Computer Architecture class but it has been difficult.</h4>
        <h4>GDScript - I've started learning it as part of making games in Godot. I've already finished one small project using GDScript alone!</h4>
        <h4>HTML/CSS - I created this website to start learning and begin my web design journey.</h4>
        <h4>JavaScript - I plan to learn JS one day and both implement it here and elsewhere.</h4>
